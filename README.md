# Avali Continued (Discontinued)

This is a GitHub repository for the Avali Continued mod and its CE patch on steam, found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1732147907)

If you have old save files from 1.1 and get def errors, I reccomend installing Eriss's original (1.1). Just put that folder into Rimworld/mods and it should appear with a folder icon in the settings.

I am not the creator of this mod, Eriss is, and the source code was entirely written by Eriss. The source codes are in Eriss's original (1.1)

I encourage to make patches if you have experience in coding for this mod. I will gladly add it to the mod, or advertise it on the description of the main mod, if you wish to publish it yourself.
